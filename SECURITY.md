# PockOS Package Security

## Repository and Package Security

While the PockOS package repository is publicly accessible to ensure transparency and ease of use, we implement several security measures to protect package contents and maintain system integrity:

### Custom Archive Format

- All PockOS packages use a proprietary archive format (.pock, .app, libro)
- The format includes multiple layers of encryption and obfuscation
- Package contents are not directly accessible through standard archive tools
- Critical application assets and code are protected from reverse engineering attempts

### Package Signing and Verification

1. **Developer Signing**
   - Every package must be signed with the developer's private key
   - Signatures are verified during package submission
   - Each developer must maintain consistent signing keys across their packages

2. **Store Signing**
   - Official store adds an additional layer of signing
   - Packages are re-signed with PockOS store keys
   - Multi-layer signature verification during installation

3. **Installation Security**
   - PockOS system verifies both developer and store signatures
   - Package integrity is checked against repository metadata
   - Installation is blocked if signatures don't match or are invalid

### Key Protection

- Developer keys are protected through secure key storage
- Store signing keys use hardware security modules
- Key rotation policies are enforced for store signing
- Compromised keys can be quickly revoked

### Runtime Protection

- Packages run in isolated environments
- System-level protections prevent unauthorized access
- Memory protection mechanisms are in place
- Runtime integrity checks detect tampering attempts

## Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Key Management**
   - Generate strong signing keys
   - Store private keys securely
   - Never share or expose private keys
   - Use different keys for development and production

2. **Package Security**
   - Implement proper code obfuscation
   - Remove debug information from releases
   - Follow secure coding guidelines
   - Regular security updates

### For Users

1. **Installation Safety**
   - Only install from official PockOS repository
   - Verify package signatures match repository data
   - Keep PockOS system updated
   - Report suspicious packages

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability:

1. **DO NOT** disclose the issue publicly
2. Email security@pockos.org with details
3. Encrypt sensitive information using our [PGP key](https://pockos.org/security/pgp-key.asc)
4. Wait for confirmation before any disclosure

## Security Updates

- Security advisories are posted on our [security portal](https://pockos.org/security)
- Critical updates are pushed through the system updater
- Subscribe to security notifications through the developer portal
